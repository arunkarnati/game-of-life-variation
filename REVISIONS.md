## Current Version

- Initial stubbing along with the i/o setup is in place.
- The computation of the cell value is still work in progress.

## Future Versions

### Next Release

- Add another field to take the future generation number. e.g., 20
- Compute the cell value correctly based on the game rules.
- Display the output of the computed generation in the same format as the input received.

### Further, Releases (good to haves, UI improvements, etc.)

- Add an option to display every generation for N seconds (can be taken as an input as well)
- UI Improvements:
  - Create a table for the grid
  - Add padding and background color for each cell based on the integer value
  - Create a legend of what that integer value means
- Add a button to stop at any time when the next generations are displayed.
- A way to generate the initial grid randomly instead of user input.
- Add buttons for each grid to reveal the value of that grid, inspiration from the minesweeper game :)
